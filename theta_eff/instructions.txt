requirements:

theta from here: https://gitlab.ekp.kit.edu/nfaltermann/theta 
For me the branch "testing" was the right one

https://github.com/UHH2/SFramePlotter for pretty plots with Torbens script

These are a bit picky wrt runtime environment. 

I got theta to run with CMSSW_7_1_19_patch1

for the plot-scripts I use CMSSW_7_6_4



scripts to run:
collect_histos.py rejiggers all the histrograms into files/naming schemes appropriate for theta

theta/utils2/theta-auto.py ThetaScaleFactorFits.py 
runs the actual fits. It will crash if one of the fits isn't converging and needs attention.


plotall.py runss all the plots using Torbens script
produces one of the fit plots
